## Project Overview
*  The Scoop is an app built for an ice cream truck so that customers can easily place an order and collect their items with an order number. The business owner will be able to see how many orders were made for each scoop type and customers can see how much their order will be at the end of the process.

You can view the deployed website [here](https://the-scoop-icecream.herokuapp.com/)

## How to use The Scoop
* First the customer is welcomed to the app and asked for their name. If valid, the customer and make their first order.

* If their name input is not valid, the customer will get a hint about what is wrong.

* The menu displayed will ask for the number of scoops.

* The menu will display again if the input is not valid.

* The app will then ask the customer if they'd like to order another ice cream.

* If no, the customer will receive notice that their order is complete and the price of the order is displayed.
* The customer can proceed to the collection point to pay and pick up their order according to the number.

## Features
Use this section to itemize the features of your project. 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into piece parts or core functionality blocks such as data upload, user input, analysis and data output; focusing on the atomic functions and data model(s) or classes you created to make the program work. 


### Implemented Features
In each subsection, write out what the feature is for and what value it adds. If there is terminal interaction or output associated with the function, include a screenshot.

### Future Features

* For future development, the app could allow for a login/sign up function to collect basic info about The Scoop customer for a possible rewards program e.g for every 5 double scoops, get a single scoop free.
* The Scoop is a growing business, as the product offering increases (such as toppings, cone/cup, flavours) these options could be added to the app.

## Design Documents

This section is where you would share logic diagrams and spreadsheets that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. 

The flowchart can be as simple as a picture of a drawing of how you envisioned laying out the logic for you project, or done with a professional tool such as powerpoint, googlesheets, or [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/) They are a roadmap and do not have to be 100% accurate of the final product.

## Data Model/ Classes
In this section write our your data model(s) or classes. 

You might want to include subsections that include how the data in the model is initialized and then the methods that you created to update it through the program.


You can create a table and take a screenshot, or you can write up subsections in markdown:

### Class X
To better group the game as an object, I wrote a class representing its properties and had method functions to update those properties: 

**Properties**
- property 1: is a {string} it represents {something} 
- property 2: is a {string} it represents {something} 

**Methods**
- **\_\_init\_\_**: Initialize method, it starts the class off with default parameters as if a user just started to play a game.
- **\_\_str\_\_**: Returns a string representation of the class/object

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your features and ensure that they all work as intended in an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, run it through the pep8online validator

- [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/) include a screenshot of results

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why. 

If the line is too long just add 
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

### Manual Testing

Use Markdown to track how you tested each bit of user input for each valid option, various invalid entries and leading/trailing spaces

**Feature 1**
- [ ] invalid entry, says sorry and repropts
- [ ] no entry, says sorry and reprompts
- [ ] alpha when numeric expected, sorry and reprompts
- [ ] valid entry with leading spaces, trimmed and shows proper next stage
- [ ] valid entry with trailing spaces, trimed and shows proper next stage

You should also call out how you tested any other features such as:
- Welcome Message, recaps user name
- Score update shows current score
- color change for correct vs incorrect
- google sheet updated properly

If you prefer spreadsheets, create a googlesheet and link to it in this section, just make sure you update the permissions to allow anyone to view it.

### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and link to them directly here.

### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impacting a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and  link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline and lack of skills. It's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live than let asccessors think you didn't notice it.

## Deployment
This application will be deployed via [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

1. Log into Heroku.

2. Navigate to Dashboard. 

3. Click "New" and select "Create New app" from the drop-down menu. Name the application something unique and select your region.

4. Click "Create App".

5.	Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "config vars".

6. Click "Reveal Config Var", in the field key enter CREDS and in the value field copy and paste the contents of creds.json file.

7. Scroll down to "build packs", click "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js" ensuring python is first on the list.

8. Navigate to the "Deploy" section.

9. Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".

<img width="1438" alt="9" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494262/173861309-776bc0c9-ac55-482b-99db-1a901b6acad1.png">

10. Authorise the connection of Heroku to GitHub.

11. Search for the GitHub repository name to connect with and select it.

12. For Deployment there are two options, automatic deployment or manual. I chose Automatic Deployment so Heroku will re-build each time code is pushed to GitHub.

13. Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select the deployment method that you desire.

<img width="1438" alt="13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494262/173861796-8339a390-f449-4d4d-b203-f5b0d33c4924.png">

14. Force the first deployment by clicking 'deploy branch' and wait for the site to build.
15. Ensure the build was successful by checking the overview tab and the activity log should say 'Build succeeded'

16. Open the deployed site and check that the program is running.

### Gitpod
This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_email": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accoutns.google.com/0/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cer_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
